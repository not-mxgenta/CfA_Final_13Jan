This piece is inspired by games such as the 'Emily is Away' Series and Simulacra, set entirely online mimicking a fictional, interactive GUI.

I focussed on creating an aesthetically pleasing piece of interactive media, with full capability to be expanded into a puzzle game. I would have continued down that stretch, however I realised I was going well over the amount of code it was meant to be, so tried to limit it whilst maintaining a clear showcase of what would be possible.

I based it loosely on windowsXP, using a base from my creative portfolio submission and building from there to add different apps and increased interactivity. 

I created some of my own assets, mostly building out of basic shapes within p5.js, and including vectorised pictures when required. I also needed a large quantity of representative icons, for which I used icons8 > https://icons8.com/ > whilst not creating my own in the traditional sense I took great care recolouring and finding similar styles to create a cohesive design.

Although the game doesn't functional to it's full extent within the short amount of code here, you can definitely investigate a bit and get an idea of the themes and mystery involved. You should be able to find traces of a storyline about a disappearance following a halloween party set in 2016. 
    You, as the player, have found an individual (Kayla)'s laptop, following a halloween party at which she disappeared without a trace. As halloween fast approaches, you talk to the people who know her, and search through her computer to try and find out more about her, and what could have happened! You'd have to persuade her friends to trust you, whilst finding your way in to secured documents and analysing clues.
Why don't you have a look - see if you have any idea what happened based on the little information available in this very condensed version and remember, parties aren't all fun and games...

But seriously, I see real potential developing this further, and when I have some more time I'm definitely considering finishing it properly for myself.

My main challenge was overambition, as big-headed as it sounds - I started with a rough idea, and about 700 lines of code in I realised it was... way more than I anticipated. I wish I could have finished the game to it's full extent for this project, but it's not feasible in the timeframe, and it's way beyond the suggested amount of code already! 

I'm very pleased with my creation otherwise, and I think it showcased a wide range of the skills from this module - from including images, resizing and positioning, sound, interactivity, csv integration etc. 
Following your feedback on the earlier submission (creative portfolio), I would also like to point out that I think this project does have deeper themes - plenty of accidents and escalations happen at parties, teens lying to cover for each other or their own selfish gain. Often things aren't as they seem, and people hide secrets below the surface that you could never spot otherwise. I don't really know how else to explain it, but I really tried with the deeper themes and I hope it is at least somewhat more what you were looking for.
